This theme was converted from https://html.design/preview/?theme=inance into a wordpress block theme using ACF blocks.

You need ACF Pro to be able to use this theme.

This is a child theme of twentytwentyfour theme. You will need to install twentytwentyfour theme for this.

I registered/created these blocks (ACF blocks). These blocks can be used together with other gutenberg blocks.

register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/testimonial' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/hero-slider' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/feature' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/about' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/professional' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/services' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/clients' );</br>
register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/contact-us' );

Slick slider scripts works on both frontend and block editor.

Color options for color picker were customized for easy color picking. It follows the theme colors.

Header and Footer are created using editor and not created using ACF blocks. (I might update it to use ACF blocks also.)

This theme is from https://html.design/ so PLEASE do not remove credits example "Â© 2024 All Rights Reserved By Free Html Templates" at the footer.

Thank you for reading !
